# Project Structure

This project has a few separate components:

* The `cmd/distrogen` directory is a tool for generating OpenTelemetry Collector Distributions
* The `components` directory contains OpenTelemetry Collector components for two different distributions
* The rest of the project is related to the build and management of the two OpenTelemetry Collector Distributions in this project, `google-built-opentelemetry-collector` and `otelopscol`

# Generated Directories

`google-built-opentelemetry-collector` and `otelopscol` are generated directory. Do not ever manually edit files in these directories; they are only meant to be generated by `distrogen`. The make targets `gen-otelopscol` and `gen-google-built-otel` exist to generate these directories.
