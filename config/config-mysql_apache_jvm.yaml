# This config hopes to mimick the Cloud Monitoring Agent by collecting metrics from popular third-party services the Agent already supports
# and formatting the metrics in the same way, so they appear similarly in Cloud Monitoring. The services targeted here are MySQL, Apache and JVM.
# Please remove/comment-out the prometheus_exec configs that you don't need in the receivers section as well as the list in the service/pipelines/metrics/receivers section.
# Documentation specific to each exporter is found in the comment directly above its configuration

receivers:

  # https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter
  prometheus_exec/mysql:
    exec: ./prometheus_exporters/mysqld_exporter --web.listen-address=":{{port}}" --no-collect.global_variables  # this last flag reduces the amount of generated metrics, can be removed to enable all (600+) MySQL metrics
    port: 9104
    env:
    - name: DATA_SOURCE_NAME  # DATA_SOURCE_NAME and its value are needed to connect to the MySQL server, alternatively you could use a .my.cnf configuration file
      value: username:password@(host:port)/db_name  # replace all value here with your MySQL server credentials

  # https://github.com/Lusitaniae/apache_exporter
  prometheus_exec/apache:
