## Default Metrics

The following metrics are emitted by default. Each of them can be disabled by applying the following configuration:

```yaml
metrics:
  <metric_name>:
    enabled: false
```

### nvml.gpu.memory.bytes_used

Current number of GPU memory bytes used by state. Summing the values of all states yields the total GPU memory space.

| ---- | ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| model | GPU model | Any Str | Recommended |
| gpu_number | GPU index starting at 0. | Any Str | Recommended |
| uuid | GPU universally unique identifier | Any Str | Recommended |
