## Default Metrics

The following metrics are emitted by default. Each of them can be disabled by applying the following configuration:

```yaml
metrics:
  <metric_name>:
    enabled: false
```

### nvml.gpu.memory.bytes_used

Current number of GPU memory bytes used by state. Summing the values of all states yields the total GPU memory space.

| Unit | Metric Type | Value Type |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- |
| By | Gauge | Int |

#### Attributes

| Name | Description | Values |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| model | GPU model | Any Str |
| gpu_number | GPU index starting at 0. | Any Str |
| uuid | GPU universally unique identifier | Any Str |
| memory_state | GPU memory used or free. | Str: ``used``, ``free`` |

### nvml.gpu.processes.max_bytes_used

Maximum total GPU memory in bytes that was ever allocated by the process.

| Unit | Metric Type | Value Type |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- |
| By | Gauge | Int |

#### Attributes

| Name | Description | Values |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| model | GPU model | Any Str |
| gpu_number | GPU index starting at 0. | Any Str |
| uuid | GPU universally unique identifier | Any Str |
| pid | Process ID. | Any Int |
| process | Process name. | Any Str |
| command | Process command. | Any Str |
| command_line | Process command line, 1024 characters maximum. | Any Str |
| owner | Process owner. | Any Str |

### nvml.gpu.processes.utilization

Fraction of time over the process's life thus far during which one or more kernels was executing on the GPU.

| Unit | Metric Type | Value Type |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1 | Gauge | Double |

#### Attributes

| Name | Description | Values |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| model | GPU model | Any Str |
| gpu_number | GPU index starting at 0. | Any Str |
| uuid | GPU universally unique identifier | Any Str |
| pid | Process ID. | Any Int |
| process | Process name. | Any Str |
| command | Process command. | Any Str |
| command_line | Process command line, 1024 characters maximum. | Any Str |
| owner | Process owner. | Any Str |

### nvml.gpu.utilization

Fraction of time GPU was not idle since the last sample.

| Unit | Metric Type | Value Type |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1 | Gauge | Double |

#### Attributes

| Name | Description | Values |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| model | GPU model | Any Str |
| gpu_number | GPU index starting at 0. | Any Str |
